package raft

//
// this is an outline of the API that raft must expose to
// the service (or tester). see comments below for
// each of these functions for more details.
//
// rf = Make(...)
//   create a new Raft server.
// rf.Start(command interface{}) (index, term, isleader)
//   start agreement on a new log entry
// rf.GetState() (term, isLeader)
//   ask a Raft for its current term, and whether it thinks it is leader
// ApplyMsg
//   each time a new entry is committed to the log, each Raft peer
//   should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or tester)
//   in the same server.
