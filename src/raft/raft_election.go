does the election need to be terminated?
when a new leader is established:
if the current term is â‰¤ leader term, the votes will be denied by majority
if the current term is > leader term, may revoke the leader if the leader hasn't committed any entry
otherwise, the leader will turn to follower,
but the voting will still be denied by the majority due to missing committed entries from the leader, a new election will be held, and the leader server very likely be selected leader again.

no need to be terminated for new leader establishing.

do need to terminate for timeout?
if the rpcs require too long to complete, then the election thread
could accumulate
the outdated voting may establish a stale leader,
not a problem, when it sends out requests, it will contacted by higher term and it turns to follower.
for correctness, no need to terminate,
but for memory efficiency, probably should
